                    <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
                    <dd>They are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
                    <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
                    <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed down quilt and gas-fired stove. It includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
                    <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
                    <dd>A sense of adventure and some time to relax! You should also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.</dd>
